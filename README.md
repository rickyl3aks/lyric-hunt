# Lyric Hunt

This project is a web application built using Next.js 13 that allows users to search for musical lyrics. It uses the Genius API to retrieve lyrics and the [`genius-lyrics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genius-lyrics) Node.js package to interact with the API.

## Features

- Search for song lyrics based on song title or artist name.
- Display retrieved lyrics in a user-friendly format.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need an API key from the `Genius Developers` website. Follow the steps outlined in the [official documentation](https://genius.com/developers) to create your API key.
